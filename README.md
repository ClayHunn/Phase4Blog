# AI Ethics principles to data science practice: a reflection and gap analysis based on recent frameworks and practical experience.

The field of AI ethics is a messy and undefined area that will need to be improved upon and standardized in the coming years. This paper is on the coming third wave of AI ethics and contributing to this third wave by mapping AI ethical principles into the lifecycle of AI based digital services or products and combining it with explicit governance to clarify responsibilities in operationalization.

The first wave of AI is the development of socially beneficial or human-centered AI and its deployments, the second wave being the assessing the potential normative consensus and convergence of these frameworks (aka the improvement of these models), and finally the third wave of AI which builds on the previous 2 waves by exploring how to turn AI into actionable data science practice and governance and examines the spectrum of applicability of AI ethics in real-world cases.  It will highlight the standardization in specific sectors and questions the enforcement and regulatory control of integrating AI systems. 

The authors work with public authorities has shown that governments are aware of AI ethics and checklists on the national level, but they struggle to understand and implement these guidelines.  This suggests the need for broader stakeholder framework to ensure comprehensive understanding and clarity in the AI realm.

This paper focuses on the development of the framework for AI that is required for this new third wave. They try and align their AI framework with EUs Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. This paper goes on and delves into their process behind their creation of said framework.  In conclusion the paper finds that they built upon previous work mainly by Morley et al and Schneirderman connecting this work to real world use cases and defining what values and ethics are taken up by whom and how responsibility and accountability are implemented.
